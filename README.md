# An Experimental Compression Between Various Image Compression Techniques

Image is the most common type of digital data that is stored and transmitted in todayâ€™s world. The development in technology brings advanced image capturing devices with higher quality. This results in acquiring a large storage space and bandwidth. To address these challenges image compression is evolved. Image compression helps in reducing the size of the image and maintaining quality. In this paper, we are going to discuss some of the image compression algorithms like Discrete Cosine Transform, Tetrolet Transform, and K-Means Clustering technique by compressing three sample images and compare their experimental results based on the quality metrics like Compression Ratio (CR), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). This helps in understanding the performance of each algorithm based on various parameters.
